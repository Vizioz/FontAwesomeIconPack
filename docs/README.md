This package adds the [Font Awesome](https://www.fontawesome.com) v5.15.1 open source icon set to your selectable icons within the [Umbraco](https://www.umbraco.com) back office. It includes the COVID-19 free awareness icons. The package ( [Font Awesome Icon Pack](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/fontawesome-icon-pack/) ) can currently be installed directly from within the back office on both Umbraco 7 & 8 or downloaded from OUR and installed as a local package.

Once installed, to check everything is working, go to the Settings section, edit a document type and try and change the icon being used for the document type.

## Example of the icon picker being used within Umbraco
In this example we are filtering the icons to show only those icons that include "umb" in their names.
